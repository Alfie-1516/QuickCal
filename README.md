# Quick Cal 
### Description:
Driven by my enthusiasm to explore the field of Software Engineering, I made the decision to embark on recreating my calculator using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework. Taking inspiration from my previous calculator developed in Java, I meticulously designed the user interface (UI) and implemented similar code logic. Upon completing this software project, I came to the realization that I now possessed a personalized custom calculator, granting me the freedom to experiment with desired functionalities. This experience proved to be immensely rewarding and gratifying in its own right.

### How To Install:
* Using Visual studio Community (Not VSCode ) clone the repository using the github link
* After cloning the repository, wait for the project to build 
* Once the project is done building and compiling, simply click the **Start** button at the top of the nav bar

### Usage
* Unlike the standard calculator that comes with Windows, this alternative open-source application can be customized to meet the specific needs of any user.
### Tools and Framework
* C#
* Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
